This is just a simple PHP MVC framwork which I'm working on for learning purposes.

I'm trying to include Twig as the template engine and I'm having lots of difficulties finding out
how to pass results from methods as variables into the template engine and display it in the body of the html
document.

If anyone is interested in helping out I would be for ever greatful.
Thanks a thousand times for everything the open source community has already tought me.

If you f.ex. look into the models/help_model.php file there is a method called add(). It simply just returns 10 + 10.
In the help controller (controllers/help.php) there is a method called "other" which does: $this->view->add = $this->model->add();
Since the Base Controller instantiates the View class in the View Controller and the Help Controller extends the Base Controller I
do $this->view->add, and have declared a public $add at the top of the class.
Then I return $this->view->add in hope for being able to pass it as a variable into the body of the html document located under views/help/help.twig.
